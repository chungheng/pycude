# Python Implementation of Differential Evolution Algorithm with PyCUDA Arrays

_PyCUDE stands for Python-CUDA-DE._

## Description

PyCUDE is yet another package of parallel implementation for the _Differential
Evolution_ algorithm. The parallelization assumes that the objective function
can be evaluated in parallel with parameters presented in PyCUDA arrays.
